With these URL patterns defined, you can access the corresponding views for data list, data detail, data creation, data update, and data deletion using the following URLs:

Data list: /data/
Create data: /data/create/
Data detail: /data/<data_id>/
Update data: /data/<data_id>/update/

Make sure to replace <data_id> with the actual ID of the data object you want to view, update, or delete.

analysis_list: Maps to the analysis_list view, which displays a list of all analyses.
analysis_create: Maps to the analysis_create view, which handles the creation of a new analysis.
analysis_detail: Maps to the analysis_detail view, which displays the details of a specific analysis based on its ID.
analysis_update: Maps to the analysis_update view, which handles the updating of an existing analysis based on its ID.
analysis_delete: Maps to the analysis_delete view, which handles the deletion of an existing analysis based on its ID.
