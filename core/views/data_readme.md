In the above code, we have defined the following views:

data_list: Retrieves all Data objects from the database and renders a template (data_list.html) to display the list of data.
data_detail: Retrieves a specific Data object based on the provided data_id and renders a template (data_detail.html) to display the details of that data.
data_create: Handles the creation of a new Data object. It accepts a POST request, retrieves the form data, creates a new Data object, and saves it to the database. It then redirects to the data_detail view for the newly created data.
data_update: Handles the update of an existing Data object. It accepts a POST request, retrieves the form data, updates the Data object with the new values, and saves it to the database. It then redirects to the data_detail view for the updated data.
data_delete: Handles the deletion of an existing Data object. It accepts a POST request, deletes the Data object from the database, and redirects to the data_list view.
Make sure to create the corresponding HTML templates (data_list.html, data_detail.html, data_create.html, data_update.html, data_delete.html) to render the views properly.
